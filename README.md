# What is TDD (Test Driven Development)?

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written first, before the actual implementation code. This method ensures reliable, well-structured, and maintainable code.

# What phases and tools are included?

In this project, the core phases of TDD are:

- Define a failing test
- Run the test (which initially fails)
- Write minimal code to pass the test
- Refactor the code
- Repeat the process

**Tools and technologies used:**
- Python 3.10+
- Pytest
- Unittest (for comparison)
- UML Activity Diagram (to model the testing flow)

# Why use these frameworks and modeling tools?

We use TDD because:

- It improves code reliability
- Bugs are detected early
- System design becomes clearer and more modular

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Pytest: Modern, powerful, and simple testing framework for Python
- Unittest: Built-in Python testing framework, class-based

**Modeling Tool:**
- UML (Unified Modeling Language), specifically:
  - Activity Diagrams to show the logic flow of unit testing

# UML Activity Diagram used in this project

We use a simplified activity diagram to represent this process:
